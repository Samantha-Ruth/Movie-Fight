# Movie-Fight

## Description
This app allows you to choose two movies and get a comparison of box office totals and IMBD ratings between the two.

## More info
This project required multiple fetches with the help of Axios.  I learned how to create an autocomplete widget from scratch, make it universally applicable, and improve my coding style.
